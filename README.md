# Rubik Flix

Small React application connecting to [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API.

Built as used by a local movie theater, offering basically:

- Movie Discovery;
- Movie Search;
- Filtering by Rating;
- Movie Details;

Built to showcase and exercise application building.\
To install this application and run it, please see [the Available Scripts section](#Available-Scripts)

## Libraries

### `material-ui`

Material-UI was the chosen library for UI components, since it gives fast prototyping and usage.\
Affinity and experience also influenced on this choice.\

Styled Components library could be used as well, but it would introduce overhead on building the components from scratch.

### `axios`

Chosen library to connect to TMDB APIs, as it requires little setup and it is pretty straightforward.\
Implementation can be found in the [`api.js` file.](./src/services/api.js)

### `react-router`

Picked to introduce Home Page <> Detail navigation, allowing loading a Detail page directly by its url.\

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

Installs the dependencies for this application.\
You can run `npm run install` alternatively.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
